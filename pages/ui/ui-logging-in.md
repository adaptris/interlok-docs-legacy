The UI is a secured web application and only allows authorised users to log in.

![Login Page](./images/ui-user-guide/login-page.png)

{% include note.html content="After installing the Interlok container, users are able to use the default admin account:<br/>Username: `admin`<br/>Password: `admin`" %}

{% include important.html content="You should change the password on the default account as soon as it's convenient to do so." %}

A non-authenticated user will always be redirected to the login page and will need to sign in with a valid username and password to access the UI. The user can log out of the UI at any time using the Logout menu item on the navigation bar
