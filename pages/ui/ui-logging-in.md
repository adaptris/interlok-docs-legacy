The UI is a secured web application and only allows authorised users to log in.

![Login Page](./images/ui-user-guide/login-page.png)

> __NOTE__ :
> After installing the Interlok container, users are able to use the default admin account:
> Username: `admin`
> Password: `admin`

> __IMPORTANT__ :
> You should change the password on the default account as soon as it's convenient to do so.

A non-authenticated user will always be redirected to the login page and will need to sign in with a valid username and password to access the UI. The user can log out of the UI at any time using the Logout menu item on the navigation bar
