The Navigation Tree presents you with a expandable, clickable tree:

Using the plus and minus buttons you can expand the tree. Note, the tree only displays Channels, Workflows and Service Collections (as well as a special opener for the Shared Components).

Clicking on a element in the tree, will select that component in the main config panel.

## The Navigation Tree Filter ##

The Navigation Tree elements can be filtered:

Note, elements that are filtered will always display their parents and children elements. This is so you can filter and still use the features of the tree.
For example, if you were looking for service collection 'process-orders', you could filter 'process' and you would see the channel and workflow that the service collection 'process-orders' belonged to.
